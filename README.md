# Discord.py MusicBot

A simple musicbot written in Discord.py that utilizes YoutubeDL and ffmpeg to stream audio. Use the `help` command to get a list of commands!

## Additional Dependencies

Python dependencies are denoted in `requirements.txt`. To allow for streaming of media, make sure `opus` and `ffmpeg` are installed.

## Configuring

When you run the bot for the first time, a default configuration file will be generated called `config.toml`. You can enter that file and add your token, etc.

If you ever wish to restore the bot to default configuration, you can simply delete (or rename) your config file. A new one will be generated upon startup.
